## How to Clone
Let’s dive into how to clone GitHub repository to local machines. Luckily, this requires a few quick steps.

Once you’re on GitHub, find the main page of the repository. Once you’re there, click **<> Code**. There, you should see an option to clone.

Use your **Git clone command** and the **copied URL**.
